    This is a simple Java miles per gallon calculator.
    I have left numbered line comments in the file. These correspond to
    comments/thoughts I have written at the bottom of the file.
    This assignment hit home. I drive a 1986 Ford Mustang GT with a
    5.0 liter V8 engine. I wrench on it as a hobby and installed new heads,
    camshaft, intake, and exhaust. I upgraded the ECU and fuel injectors,
    then I installed a supercharger on top of all that.
    Guess how much miles per gallon that thing gets? "Smiles per gallon"

   Post-code comments:
   1.
   I am using vim at 80x50 so using a newline for long arguments
   helps me with readability. I'm unsure if this is "good" Java formatting
   I have used a 4 space indent, no tab, curly braces on newline
   and I try to line up variables I declare

   2.
   We know that the US dollar only has two decimal places
   so I am formatting my doubles this way so I can't possibly for example
   get something like $0.67373737 cents back no matter what I input
   This is USD, not BTC. We can't "really" have something like $.67373737
   I am recalling your comments on IRS and USD rounding Thursday here
